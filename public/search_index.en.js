am I?\nHi there! My name is Eduardo Quirós, and I'm a software engineering student from\nCosta Rica. Currently working on getting a Bachelor's Degree in said field.\nI have a monumental appreciation for efficient, minimalist, and well designed\ntools. This cascades into a great interest in topics such as the UNIX\nphilosophy, the Linux kernel, the various BSD projects, and cybersecurity in general.\nHow did I get here?\nEver since I was young, I've always been fascinated by the thought of learning\nthe internal mechanics, rules and constructs that govern our universe. This\nslowly transformed, thanks to the introduction of computers into my daily life,\ninto a very deep interest in what made these mesmerizing machines work.\nGranted, it was a rather complex topic for a child to comprehend at that age;\nbut the ball was rolling in my mind.\nAs the years passed, I became interested in (and developed a proficiency for)\nclasses such as Maths and the Computer Lab. As such, my first ever experience\nwith programming was with the help of\nMicroWorlds. This was a small but\neducationally effective program aimed at teaching kids some very basic\nprogramming principles. But, above all, it was fun.\nWhen I entered Third Grade, my grandmother came up with the idea of enlisting\nme in some programming courses. These were mainly oriented towards building\nrobots using Legos and some building kits (Although I did attend a class about\nmaking videogames using\nScratch.)\nThese courses did a fantastic job at keeping me interested and surrounded me\nwith the resources needed to keep learning about the field.\nSadly, my involvement in this world screeched to a halt when I turned 14, I\njust lost interest in it, probably because I was burnt out by the overwhelming\namount of information I had to take in at the time. That said, my initial\nfascination with discovering how things work \"behind the scenes\" never\ndwindled, I merely channeled it towards other fields such as Biology or Chemistry.\nThus, I went onto university at the\nCosta Rica Institute of Technology and, given my\ninterest in the natural sciences, enrolled in Environmental Engineering.\nHowever, as the courses got increasingly oriented towards what the professional\nlife of an environmental engineer would be like, I noticed that such a field\nsimply wasn't for me.\nThankfully, that major had (for reasons still unknown to me) a programming\nfundamentals course as part of its curriculum. It was a pretty basic course\nthat walked me through building some simple programs in Python, but that was\ndefinitely enough to reignite the flames that got me into computers in the first\nplace. This soon led to a career change and me relocating to\nCenfotec University, where I'm now working on\nbecoming a software engineer.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/","title":"A Little About Me..."},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/","title":"List of blog posts"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dusting-off-the-blog/":{"body":"I've certainly neglected posting here in a while, I'm gonna fix that. \nI have quite a few post ideas I'm working on, hopefully a handful of them will become full-on posts.\nI have managed to set up automatic deployment using Sourcehut Pages, which is very neat; I'm definitely gonna make a post about that soon.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dusting-off-the-blog/","title":"Dusting Off the Blog"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/how-we-expect-programs/":{"body":"A recent assignment for a university course I'm taking has me thinking about the way we might expect the behavior of a program to occur.\nLiving in a UNIX context (due to using Linux as my daily driver), I generally expect the utility programs I use to go through the following process:\n\nStart up.\nGather input.\nProcess input.\nOutput result or show an error, and quit.\n\nThis sounds pretty normal in my eyes, but some teachers are inclined more towards the process of:\n\nStart program.\nProgram asks for input.\nIf input is correct, process it; if not, loop back and ask user to try again.\n\nThis process is expected to happen for every single input expected from the user for the lifetime of the process. This comes off as pretty clunky, and the code reflects that.\nuse std::io;\n\nuse regex::Regex;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut condition = true;\n    let mut input_invalid = true;\n    while condition {\n        let mut year_input = String::new();\n        while input_invalid {\n            println!(\"Ingrese un año: \");\n            io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut year_input).expect(\"Fallo\");\n            input_invalid = !Regex::new(\"^[1-9]+$\").unwrap().is_match(year_input.trim());\n            if input_invalid {\n                println!(\"La entrada necesita ser de números solamente\");\n            }\n        }\n        input_invalid = true;\n        let clean_input = year_input.trim();\n        if is_leap_year(clean_input.parse().unwrap()) {\n            println!(\"El año {} es bisiesto\", &amp;clean_input);\n        } else {\n            println!(\"El año {} NO es bisiesto\", &amp;clean_input);\n        }\n        let mut must_confirm = true;\n        while must_confirm {\n            println!(\"Desea continuar? [y/n]\");\n            let mut confirm = String::new();\n            io::stdin()\n                .read_line(&amp;mut confirm)\n                .expect(\"confirmación falló\");\n            must_confirm = !Regex::new(\"^(?:y|n)$\").unwrap().is_match(confirm.trim());\n            condition = !matches!(confirm.trim(), \"n\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn is_leap_year(year_input: u32) -&gt; bool {\n    if Regex::new(r#\"00$\"#)\n        .unwrap()\n        .is_match(&amp;year_input.to_string())\n    {\n        year_input % 400 == 0\n    } else {\n        year_input % 4 == 0\n    }\n}\n\nAs you can see, there are quite a few loops that exist only to nag the user into providing a correct input. This, in my eyes, becomes an incredibly annoying way of using a program.\nInput validation in this style might work well when it comes to using graphically presented forms, where the person can re-evaluate the information they introduced; it is not so for interactive inputs in a one-shot CLI program since it's incredibly uncomfortable to \"go back\" and edit different inputs you've previously provided.\nA much simpler (and actually closer in practicality to normal web forms) approach is to use flags or command line arguments, this allows the person to edit, in a single view, all the information they are passing to the program even before said program executes. This also allows for a much more standard way of designing said program, as most languages either provide a library designed for CLI applications, or the ecosystem has a few third-party libraries for the same purpose. In the case of Rust (the language used to make the program above), there's the (clap crate)[https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/], which provides many useful functions for this endeavor.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/how-we-expect-programs/","title":"How We Expect Programs To Behave"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/intro/":{"body":"This is is the very first post in my new blog, this time I'll be using \nHugo to generate it instead of WordPress.\nIn general, the experience has been very straightforward, I write my entries in \nmarkdown and Hugo handles the\nconversion to HTML pages.\nI don't hate WordPress at all, and consider it to still be a valuable service\nand overall website builder, but I tend to lean towards the more manual\nexperiences when it comes to computers.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/intro/","title":"Intro"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/outside-comfort-zone/":{"body":"Intro\nRecently, I had a class which required conversion between a few numeric systems\nsuch as binary (base2), decimal (the \"normal\" one we use, base10), and base16.\n(It was actually a couple more, but for this blogpost only those three are relevant.)\nA classmate of mine asked the professor if it was alright for him, in a\nconversion between binary and base16, to convert to decimal as a middle step.\nThis initially seems as a good practice. Since decimal is a system that we've\nall used since we learned to count, it makes sense to want to use it as a\nmiddleground between two unknown systems.\nIn a situation where time and success are critical, it's natural to want to\nstick to what you already know.\nThe Problem with this Approach\nIn principle, I don't necessarily advise people to stray from their comfort\nzone when performing a critical task; when dealing with little margin for error,\none should always exercise caution and stick to what works. However, in class,\nit's experimentation time.\nReasoning\nFor numerical systems that share a common base (base16 is, technically, base2^4),\nconversion is actually simpler than it would be using a different system\nwith an incongruous base as a middleground. To prove this, let's do a little math...\nThe Smart, But \"Uncomfortable\" Way\nFor a base16 number, each of its figures can be represented as 4 figures in binary.\nTherefore, if the number were to be 52 in base16, then the 5 would be 0101\nand the 2 would be 0010. Problem solved. Steps taken: 2. (3, if you wanna\ncount writing 01010010 together as a step.)\nThe \"Comfortable\", But Convoluted Way\nWhereas converting it to decimal would entail multiplying 5 by 16 and then\nadding 2 to that, and then dividing 84 (the result of the previous\nconversion) by 2 over and over again until the remainder is either 1 or 0,\nthat's six divisions you have to carry out in order to convert a decimal\nnumber of two figures.\nWhich then nets you 0101 0010, which is the exact same result we reached\nearlier. Steps: 7 (if you consider conversion from base16 to decimal a single\nstep, and I know you don't.)\nConclusion\nThis was merely an example of the myriad of situations in which stretching your\nlimits a bit can save you tons of time. If you've read\nmy previous post, then you know that, even though\nlearning to use it may seem difficult at first, it'll definitely save you lots\nof headaches later on.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/outside-comfort-zone/","title":"Outside Your Comfort Zone"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/you-should-use-git/":{"body":"The Problem\nI've noticed that, at the university I go to, many of my peers often have trouble\nlearning to use git (or any form of VCS, really) and, therefore, opt to simply\nnot use it at all.\nI believe this is a mistake, by not using any sort of version control you subject\nyourself to a whole host of difficulties and challenges if you simply let your\nlack of comfort with such a tool get to you.\nManaging File Versions\nThis one seems like the obvious argument to make for a tool with \"version control\"\nin its name, but I've noticed that people who don't use a VCS often try to make\nup for this lack of control by having multiple copies of the same file.\nThis isn't particularly wrong per sé, and it initially seems to be a clever workaround.\nHowever, most projects at my university often last between 3 an 15 weeks.\nWould you honestly trust yourself to handle multiple versions of various projects\neffectively?\nEvery single one?\nThis is where a VCS comes in, long gone are the days of needing a folder\ncontaining (I'm using Java as an example language because that's what my\nuniversity uses as an introductory language)\nproject_directory\n|-projectv1.java\n|-projectv2.java\n|-projectv3.java\n\nlittered all over your project directory.\nGit handles this versioning by storing the changes you've progressively made to\nyour files via \"commits\". These are atomic \"bundles\" of changes you decide to\nmake permanent on your project. This way, Git slowly builds up a history of all\nthe changes you've made ever since the first commit.\nRolling back\nThe main reason I've seen stated for multiple versions of a file is the desire\nfor being able to roll back any changes you've made to a file. Git also handles\nthis very well, you simply have to look at your project history, pick a commit\nyou want to roll back to, issue the command and boom, you've gone back in time!\nBackups / Multiple Copies\nAnother of the main draws of a VCS is the ability to store remote backups in\ncase of a catastrophic event.\nSeveral times some of my colleagues have told stories about how a disgruntled\nformer teammate decided to wipe out a project repository or about how they\nunintentionally deleted the project repo from their own machine.\nLuckily, a VCS also has that situation in mind.\nBy allowing for remote repositories, a VCS makes it easy to store remotely all\nof your project history and current state.\nAll you need to do is use a remote server such as Codeberg\nor Sourcehut.\nThese will take care of storing your remote repo safely.\nHaving this system in place, you can back up your commits by simply running\ngit push, and git will handle the job of moving the changes you've made in\nyour local repo over to your remote repo. If you want to download the changes\nyou've (or someone else has) made, you simply run git pull.\nAnd so, if something happens to my local repo, the remote one will still be\nintact. The only commits lost would be the ones I hadn't pushed at the time of loss.\nConversely, if anything catastrophic happened to my remote repo (or repos, Git\nallows for multiple remotes and such), then the only commits that I'd lose would\nbe those that I hadn't pulled from there yet.\nNOTE: Remember that if you don't regularly push your changes to your remote\nrepo then there's nothing Git and other VCSs can do to save you.\nConclusion\nGit is capable of many more things than what I mentioned here, but the benefits\nI listed are what would've saved many projects ~90% of the time.\nBeing honest, you're simply depriving yourself from proper project management\nif you opt to not use a VCS.\nIt might not be the easiest tool to learn, but it'll be the one tool you want\nmost whenever something goes wrong with your project.\nIf you're a student in anything concerning handling plaintext files such as\ncode, seriously, you should use Git!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/you-should-use-git/","title":"You Should Use Git"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/uses/":{"body":"This is just an index of the hardware I'm using,\nmostly to keep track without needing to have a bunch of papers about it.\nDesktop\nSnowfort\n\nCPU: Ryzen 5 3600X\nGPU: ASROCK Radeon 5500XT 4GB CHALLENGER\nPower Supply: 650W AZZA 80+ Bronze\nCase: AZZA Crimson 211G\nRAM: DDR4 8GB 3000MHz XPG Hunter x2\nSSD: 2.5\" Patriot Burst 240GB\nHDD: Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200rpm\nMonitor: 24' ASUS LED VP249QGR/144Hz/1ms/1920x1080 HDMI/VGA/DP\nOperating System: NixOS\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/uses/","title":"Uses"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":240,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/dusting-off-the-blog/":{"body":35,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/how-we-expect-programs/":{"body":269,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/intro/":{"body":42,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/outside-comfort-zone/":{"body":230,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/you-should-use-git/":{"body":374,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/uses/":{"body":59,"title":1}},"length":9},"lang":"English"};

I've certainly neglected posting here in a while, I'm gonna fix that. 
I have quite a few post ideas I'm working on, hopefully a handful of them will become full-on posts.

I **have** managed to set up automatic deployment using [Sourcehut Pages](https://srht.site/), which is *very* neat; I'm definitely gonna make a post about that soon.

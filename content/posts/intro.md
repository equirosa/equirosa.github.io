This is is the very first post in my new blog, this time I'll be using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate it instead of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org).

In general, the experience has been very straightforward, I write my entries in
[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and Hugo handles the
conversion to HTML pages.

I don't hate WordPress at all, and consider it to still be a valuable service
and overall website builder, but I tend to lean towards the more manual
experiences when it comes to computers.
